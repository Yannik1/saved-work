                    It is also the role of the Managing Director to convene a Board of Directors and manage any communication between the Board and the Chairperson/Shareholders.
                    On a secondary level there are a number of other responsibilities that the Managing Director may have. 
                    The Managing Director will be responsible for representing the company in public at events or with the press.
                    They will be responsible for leading, coaching and mentoring other board members and supporting their professional development. 
                    The MD will work alongside other board members to identify operational performance measures and will require an understanding of 
                    finance related issues in order to analyse company performance.
