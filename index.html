                                        It is our policy to ensure that no job applicant nor current employee receives less favourable 
                                        treatment due to a “protected characteristic” (ie gender, disability, marital status, religion or belief, race, age, sex, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, pregnancy, 
                                        gender reassignment or civil partnership) 
                                        or is disadvantaged by any conditions or requirements being placed on him/her which cannot be justified. 
                                        The Company will seek to ensure that individuals are recruited, selected, trained and promoted on the basis 
                                        of their aptitude, skills and abilities.
